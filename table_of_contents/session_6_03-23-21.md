#### Using CSS with Nativescript
- adapt an existing simple framework (tedious)
	- remove any element selectors, change to class references
- build our own simple css ruleset (exhaustive)
	- build rules as we iterate for our needs
- or https://www.nativescriptthemebuilder.com/
	- How do we include this in a fresh template?

#### Layout and space
- from the Nativescript-Vue Docs page, navigate to Elements:Layouts
- each section describes a different layout approach
- most familiar or typical layouts
	- grid, lets you create columns and rows which can fill a frame
	- stack, lets you flow content in different sections
	- absolute, lets you specify exactly where things go
		- same shape, size, position no matter the frame
- identify the layout included in the template
	- at the app level
	- at the component level
- tool from NativeScript: https://www.nslayouts.com/

### Making a simple counter
1. an increment
2. a decrement
3. a reset
4. a count

#### Adding elements
- a label
	- we'll need this for our count
- some icons (up and down)
	- 'Label' with ns
	- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity
	- how to change the icon size?
	- next to one another
- a button
	- for resetting
	- below the increment and decrement

#### Positioning and style
- with Nativescript, we use the layout system to position
	- avoid using css to adjust position, will conflict with layout
- style is handled with our theming
	- changes just for the counter control in the components folder
	- changes for the whole app in the app.scss file
