### Using CSS with Nativescript
- adapt an existing simple framework (tedious)
	- remove any element selectors, change to class references
- build our own simple css ruleset (exhaustive)
	- build rules as we iterate for our needs
- or https://www.nativescriptthemebuilder.com/
	- How do we include this in a fresh template?

#### Reference a css file
- add the file to the app folder
- add the following to your `app.scss`
```css
@import "~@nativescript/theme/css/core.css";
@import "~@nativescript/theme/css/default.css";
@import url("your_custom_file.css");
```
	- will apply for all items in your application
	- make sure to reference the classes found in your rule set

#### Layout and space
- from the Nativescript-Vue Docs page, navigate to Elements:Layouts
- each section describes a different layout approach
- most familiar or typical layouts
	- grid, lets you create columns and rows which can fill a frame
	- stack, lets you flow content in different sections
	- absolute, lets you specify exactly where things go
		- same shape, size, position no matter the frame
- identify the layout included in the template
	- at the app level
	- at the component level
- tool from NativeScript: https://www.nslayouts.com/
