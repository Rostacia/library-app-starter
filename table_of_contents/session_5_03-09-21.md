#### Simple frameworks for appearance
a css framework
- (a collection of accessible references for bringing in meaning and for referencing complex code quickly / easily)
- can quickly achieve something functional for our UI
- lets us get a much stronger idea of the shape of an app range from deep and configurable to simple and immediate

simple and immediate rec. for web:
https://yegor256.github.io/tacit/

for our app:
- keep in mind, we rely on css classes
	- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors
- NativeScript doesn't use html
	- https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling

options:
- adapt an existing simple framework (tedious)
	- remove any element selectors, change to class references
- build our own simple css ruleset (exhaustive)
	- build rules as we iterate for our needs
- or https://www.nativescriptthemebuilder.com/
	- How do we include this in a fresh template?

#### Layout and space
- from the Docs page, navigate to Elements:Layouts
- each section describes a different layout approach
	- tool from NativeScript: https://www.nslayouts.com/
- identify the layout included in the template
	- at the app level
	- at the component level

#### Change some items
- In the 'Items' tab, list of arbitrary itmes
- change some of the items to be meaningful
- remove a lot of the extras

#### App idea
- personal reference
	- a wiki
- business services app
	- appointment booking
	- service selection
