> Introductions
		contact me at: coder@nhfpl.org
		sign up for my office hours: https://calendly.com/coder-nhfpl

> Entrepreneur in-residence
	Marina will speak about non-technical application building

> Native applications
		these apps run with code that is 'native' to the operating environment
		swift or objective c, kotlin on android (java), the .net framework

		Microsoft's Xamarin (9 yr)
			https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/

			uses the .net framework ecosystem
				producese a native app
			XAML, creating simple applications from forms alone
				markdown makes for approachable building
			Good visual studio integration
			Microsoft docs
			provides example

> Hybrid applications
		will allow us to use some arbitrary tech framework, maybe more typically suited for ui web (frameworks)
		https://ionicframework.com/resources/articles/what-is-hybrid-app-development
			
		Ionic (8 yr)
			https://ionicframework.com/

			accompanied by deployment / support
				hosting, security, admin tools
				good for scaling
					this is high value for growing quickly
			common web framework approaches
				react, angular, vue js
			popular, big community / documentation
			provides example

		others include Flutter via Google (uses the Dart lang), Cordova from Apache (html/js/css), and meteor (Mac bias)

	all have verbose tutorials, documentation
	and avenues for setting up a sample application quickly

> NativeScript application framework
	we're going to pick a native approach that allows us to use some common technologies 
	as a compromise

	Nativescript (6 yr)
		https://nativescript-vue.org/
		free and open-source
		use popular frameworks for building your application
		produces native apps
		web based playground environment for creating apps
			with designer
			immediately usable in mobile!

	- good docs
  - core technologies will be used to make our app
