> Source Control for tracking our code
	https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/git-cheat-sheet.pdf
		instructions and survey of common tasks

	source control tools like Git let us keep track of our changes
	we can view our progress over time and find old changes quickly
	
	The Github platform lets us use Git to share our code with others
	and helps us find code resources that we can collaborate on

> Notes on browsing Github
	do they have a site for the project?
	readme?
	last commit?
	open issues?
	pull requests?

> Vue for js, for NativeScript
	using just JavaScript
		fewer dependencies
		distributed code structure
		flexible organization

	with Vue
		gradual learning curve
		single 'view' file
		app contained as a component
			new addition -> new component

	compare templates for yourself

> Investigate the project
	App_Resources
		platform specific configuration settings

	node_modules, package-lock.json
		the dependencies we need for our app
		the versions and requirements list

	src/app.scss
		core styling, theme styling
		what happens when removed?

	src/main.js
		starting point for our application
		notice the 'import' at the top of the file
	
		follow this to..

	src/components
		App.vue
			nice advantage of Vue - self-contained component
		what happens if we remove the core styles?

	src/assets
		keep images and icons
		
> Simple frameworks for appearance
	a basic css framework
		(a collection of accessible references for bringing in meaning and for referencing complex code quickly / easily)
	can quickly achieve something functional for our UI
		lets us get a much stronger idea of the shape of an app
		range from deep and configurable to simple and immediate

	simple and immediate rec. for web:
	https://yegor256.github.io/tacit/

	for our app:
	keep in mind, we rely on classes because NativeScript doesn't use html
		https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling

	options:
		adapt an existing simple framework (tedious)

		build our own simple css ruleset (exhaustive)

> Layout and spacing
	from the Docs page, view layouts section
	looking at the approaches, we can see some familiar looks
		try to imagine how you see your information being displayed

	tool from NativeScript: https://www.nslayouts.com/

> App idea
	personal reference
		a wiki
	business services app
		appointment booking
		service selection
