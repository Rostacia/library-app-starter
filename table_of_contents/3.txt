> Using a code editor (IDE)
	https://atom.io/
		good option for a simple full featured editor, lightweight
	https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
		visual studio code is a lightweight free editor, offers a lot of features inspired by visual studio

> Developing locally
	Specifically, we'll need:
		Node.js
			this is an engine for JavaScript code - it lets us run JavaScript outside of the browser
			Node.js ships with npm, a node package manager that will allow us to download additional development tools
		nativescript-cli
			this is a tool we'll use to setup our nativescript apps
		vue-cli-template
			this is a package that we can use to start Vue.js apps from scratch with different layout options

	go to the Docs page: https://nativescript-vue.org/en/docs/introduction/ (bookmark)

	Node.js and the nativescript-cli:
		visit the 'Installation' link in the left-hand sidebar
		follow the instructions listed for your system / intended platform

		NOTE on node.js / npm: if you're not using Windows, you might find that you get permissions errors
			https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory
	
	vue-cli-template:
		back to the Docs page, visit the 'Quick Start' link on the left 
		click the 'vue-cli-template' link
		follow the instructions below the 'Usage' heading
		
		for the @vue/cli package, run
			npm install -g @vue/cli@latest @vue/cli-init@latest

			instead of

			npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-init
		
		NOTE: after the install, you may need to run 
			source ~/.profile
			if you had permissions errors, in order to use the 'vue' cmd

		run the init command, which will setup the template code
		navigate to the new project folder and run the 'npm install' command
			this will pull all the necessary packages together for the application

> Preview locally
	If you still have the NativeScript Playground and NativeScript Preview apps
	run the preview like we did in the web playground by executing

	ns preview

	and snapping a picture of the QR code provided
	this should generate a preview with different navigation features

> Advanced setup
	Once you've selected your platform
	Follow the setup so you can build apps to target your device 
	
	Visit the 'Installation' link on the left side of the Vue Docs page
	and scroll down to the Operating System you're using now

> Source Control for tracking our code
		source control tools like Git let us keep track of our changes
		we can view our progress over time and find old changes quickly
		
		The Github platform lets us use Git to share our code with others
		and helps us find code resources that we can collaborate on

> App idea
	business services app
		appointment booking
		service selection

	apps with 'Form' basis versus free-form apps

> If you haven't already...
	Go through the NativeScript Vue Playground tutorial
	Follow the steps above to setup a local workstation
		try to target a platform that you can emulate or test before going to the phone
	Create your Github
